This is a plugin for ATAK (Android Team Awareness Kit) that uses Meshtastic to provide off-grid communications. This includes plotting the position of others on the map, transmission of markers and routes, and chat messages. It has been signed by the TAK Product Center for use with the Play Store version of ATAK. He is currently distributing development builds via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xeKJnn9tmzkkmuDbMp0LCLOV9OzHU-Ex), aiming to publish it to the Play Store in the future.

The builds of the plugin on the Google Drive currently aren't signed for the Play Store version of ATAK yet. At the moment you will need to install the dev build of ATAK from the drive link to use the plugin.

The ATAK plugin requires the Meshtastic Android app to be installed.
