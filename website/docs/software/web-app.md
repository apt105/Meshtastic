The Meshtastic firmware incorporates an embedded webserver using the [ESP32 HTTPS Server](https://github.com/fhessel/esp32_https_server) project. This allows the wifi supporting ESP32 devices to run our Meshtastic-web application. This imports the [Meshtastic.js library](/docs/js/getting-started) to provide a web page capable of interacting with the device.
